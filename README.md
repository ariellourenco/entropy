# ENTROPY

A chaotic experimental playground for new ideas, collection of prototypes, samples and proof-of-concepts. None of this is meant to be used in production code, but you can take any of the ideas you like and try them out in your own projects.

I highly recommend using Visual Studio Code to play around with these samples but it is not required. You can use Visual Studio 2019 as well.
